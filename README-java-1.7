To build and run Nakamura under the Sun Java 1.7 JVM it is necessary to disable
the 1.7 type verifier in order to work with Maven dependencies compiled for 1.5
and 1.6. This is particularly needed for several Felix and Jackrabbit
dependencies.

Compiling
---------
Export MAVEN_OPTS including the flag -XX:-UseSplitVerifier

   export MAVEN_OPTS="-XX:-UseSplitVerifier $MAVEN_OPTS"

Executing
---------
Export JAVA_OPTS including the flag -XX:-UseSplitVerifier

   export JAVA_OPTS="-XX:-UseSplitVerifier $JAVA_OPTS"

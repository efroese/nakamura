Fry until the popping ceases and drain the greens paper towels in a single layer. Salt lightly and allow to cool. Greens will crisp up once cooled.  3. In a separate small saucepot, combine the raisins, sherry, brown sugar, white balsamic, water and lemon zest and cook over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced by 70% and is syrupy. Add in the fresh lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper.  4. Toss the fried kale and sage with the roasted mushrooms and the toasted pine nuts. Drizzle the raisin vinaigrette over the mushroom salad and serve immediately.         2 eet recipes from Stephanie Izard   Simple Roasted Beet Salad Serves 4   4 medium to large beets (about 1 1/2-2 pounds total) 2 tablespoons olive oil Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 ounces arugula 4 ounces goat cheese (such as Humboldt Fog) 3 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper   Preheat the oven to 400° F.
